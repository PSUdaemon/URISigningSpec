      <t>This document describes how the concept of URI Signing supports the
      content access control requirements of Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) and proposes a URI Signing
      method as a JSON Web Token (JWT) profile.</t>
      <t>The proposed URI Signing method specifies the information needed to
      be included in the URI to transmit the signed JWT, as well as the claims needed
      by the signed JWT to authorize a User Agent (UA). The
      mechanism described can be used both in CDNI and single Content Delivery Network (CDN)
      scenarios.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document describes the concept of URI Signing and how it can be
      used to provide access authorization in the case of redirection between
      cooperating CDNs and between a Content Service Provider (CSP)
      and a CDN. The primary goal of URI Signing is to make sure that only
      authorized UAs are able to access the content, with a CSP
      being able to authorize every individual request. It should be noted
      that URI Signing is not a content protection scheme; if a CSP wants to
      protect the content itself, other mechanisms, such as Digital Rights Management (DRM), are more
      appropriate. In addition to access control, URI Signing also has
      benefits in reducing the impact of denial-of-service attacks.</t>
      <t>The overall problem space for CDN Interconnection (CDNI) is described
      in the CDNI Problem Statement <xref target="RFC6707" format="default"/>
      specification. This document, along with the <xref target="RFC7337"
      format="default">Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Requirements</xref> document and the <xref
      target="RFC7336" format="default">Framework for Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI)</xref>, describes the
      need for interconnected CDNs to be able to implement an access control
      mechanism that enforces a CSP's distribution policies.</t>
      <t>Specifically, the <xref target="RFC7336" format="default">CDNI Framework</xref>
      states:</t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
        <li>The CSP may also trust the CDN operator to perform actions such as
        delegating traffic to additional downstream CDNs, and to enforce per-request authorization performed by the CSP using
        techniques such as URI Signing.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>In particular, the following requirement is listed in the <xref target="RFC7337" format="default">CDNI Requirements</xref>:</t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
	<li>
	  <blockquote><dl><dt>MI-16</dt><dd>{HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow signaling of
          authorization checks and validation that are to be performed
          by the Surrogate before delivery.  For example, this could
          potentially include the need to validate information (e.g.,
          Expiry time, Client IP address) required for access
          authorization.</dd>
	  </dl>
	  </blockquote>
</li>


      </ul>
      <t>This document defines a method of signing URIs that allows Surrogates in
      interconnected CDNs to enforce a per-request authorization initiated by
      the CSP. Splitting the role of initiating per-request authorization by
      the CSP and the role of verifying this authorization by the CDN allows
      any arbitrary distribution policy to be enforced across CDNs without the
      need of CDNs to have any awareness of the specific CSP distribution
      policies.</t>
      <t>The method is implemented using signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/>.</t>

        <name>Background and Overview on URI Signing</name>
        <t>A CSP and CDN are assumed to have a trust relationship that enables
        the CSP to authorize access to a content item, which is
        realized in practice by including a set of claims in a signed JWT
        in the URI before redirecting a UA to the CDN. Using these
        attributes, it is possible for a CDN to check an incoming content
        request to see whether it was authorized by the CSP (e.g., based on
        a time window or pattern matching the URI). To prevent the UA from altering the claims,
        the JWT <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be signed.</t>
        <t><xref target="fig_single_cdn" format="default"/> presents an overview of the URI Signing
        mechanism in the case of a CSP with a single CDN. When the UA browses
        for content on CSP's website (1), it receives HTML web pages with
        embedded content URIs. Upon requesting these URIs, the CSP redirects
        to a CDN, creating a Target CDN URI (2) (alternatively, the Target
        CDN URI itself is embedded in the HTML). The Target CDN URI is the
        Signed URI, which may include the IP address of the UA and/or a time
        window. The signed URI always contains a signed JWT generated by the
        CSP using a shared secret or private key. Once the UA receives the
        response with the Signed URI, it sends a new HTTP request using the
        Signed URI to the CDN (3). Upon receiving the request, the CDN
        authenticates the Signed URI by verifying the signed JWT.
        If applicable, the CDN checks whether the time window is still valid
        in the Signed URI and the pattern matches the URI of the request.
        After these claims are verified, the CDN delivers the content (4).</t>
        <t>Note: While using a symmetric shared key is supported, it is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.

        <name>CDNI URI Signing Overview</name>
        <t>In a CDNI environment, as shown in <xref target="fig_cdni_env" format="default"/> below, URI Signing operates the same way in the
        initial steps 1 and 2, but the later steps involve multiple CDNs
        delivering the content. The main difference from the
        single CDN case is a redirection step between the uCDN and the
        dCDN. In step 3, the UA may send an HTTP request or a DNS request,
        depending on whether HTTP-based or DNS-based request routing is used.
        The uCDN responds by directing the UA towards the
        dCDN using either a Redirection URI (i.e., a Signed URI generated by
        the uCDN) or a DNS reply, respectively (4). Once the UA
        receives the response, it sends the Redirection URI/Target CDN URI to
        the dCDN (5). The received URI is verified by the
        dCDN before delivering the content (6).</t>

        </figure>
        <t>The trust relationships between CSP, uCDN, and
        dCDN have direct implications for URI Signing. In the case shown in
        <xref target="fig_cdni_env" format="default"/>, the CSP has a trust relationship with the
        uCDN. The delivery of the content may be delegated to a
        dCDN, which has a relationship with the uCDN but may
        have no relationship with the CSP.</t>
        <t>In CDNI, there are two methods for request routing: DNS-based and
        HTTP-based. For DNS-based request routing, the Signed URI (i.e., the Target
        CDN URI) provided by the CSP reaches the CDN directly. In
        the case where the dCDN does not have a trust relationship
        with the CSP, this means that either an asymmetric public/private key
        method needs to be used for computing the signed JWT (because the CSP and
        dCDN are not able to exchange symmetric shared secret keys). Shared keys <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
        be redistributed.</t>
        <t>For HTTP-based request routing, the Signed URI (i.e., the Target CDN
        URI) provided by the CSP reaches the uCDN. After this URI has
        been verified by the uCDN, the uCDN
        creates and signs a new Redirection URI, redirecting the UA to the
        dCDN. Since this new URI can have a new signed JWT, the relationship between the
        dCDN and CSP is not relevant. Because a
        relationship between uCDN and dCDN always exists,
        either asymmetric public/private keys or symmetric shared secret keys
        can be used for URI Signing with HTTP-based request routing. Note that the signed Redirection URI <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
        maintain HTTPS as the scheme if it was present in the original, and it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be upgraded from "http:" to "https:".</t>
        <t>Two types of keys can be used for URI Signing: asymmetric keys and
        symmetric shared keys. Asymmetric keys are based on a public/private key pair
        mechanism and always contain a private key known only to the entity
        signing the URI (either CSP or uCDN) and a public key for the
        verification of the Signed URI. With symmetric keys, the same key is
        used by both the signing entity for signing the URI and the
        verifying entity for verifying the Signed URI. Regardless of the type
        of keys used, the verifying entity has to obtain the key in a manner that allows trust to
        be placed in the assertions made using that key (either the
        public or the symmetric key). There are very different requirements
        (outside the scope of this document) for distributing asymmetric keys
        and symmetric keys. Key distribution for symmetric keys requires
        confidentiality to prevent third parties from getting access to the key,
        since they could then generate valid Signed URIs for unauthorized
        requests. Key distribution for asymmetric keys does not require
        confidentiality since public keys can typically be distributed openly
        (because they cannot be used to sign URIs) and the corresponding private keys are kept
        secret by the URI signer.</t>
        <t>Note: While using a symmetric shared key is supported, it is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>.

        <t>While the URI Signing method defined in this document was primarily
        created for the purpose of allowing URI Signing in CDNI scenarios,

      <name>JWT Format and Processing Requirements</name>
      <t>The concept behind URI Signing is based on embedding a signed <xref target="RFC7519" format="default">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>
      in an <xref target="RFC7230" format="default">HTTP or HTTPS URI</xref> (see <xref target="RFC7230" sectionFormat="of" section="2.7"/>). The signed JWT contains a number of

      <t>This document specifies the following attribute for embedding a signed JWT in a Target CDN URI or Redirection URI:</t>

      <dl>

	<dt>URI Signing Package (URISigningPackage): 
	</dt>
	<dd>The URI attribute that encapsulates all the URI Signing claims in
	a signed JWT encoded format. This attribute is exposed in the Signed
	URI as a path-style parameter or a form-style parameter.
	</dd>
</dl>


      <t>The parameter name of the URI Signing Package Attribute is
      defined in the <xref target="metadata" format="default">CDNI Metadata</xref>. If the CDNI Metadata interface
      is not used, or does not include a parameter name for the URI Signing
      Package Attribute, the parameter name can be set by configuration (out of

      <t>The URI Signing Package will be found by parsing any path-style parameters and

      Both parameter styles <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be supported to allow flexibility of operation.
      The first matching parameter <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be taken to provide the signed JWT, though providing
      more than one matching key is undefined behavior. Path-style parameters generated in the

        <name>JWT Claims</name>
        <t>This section identifies the set of claims that can be
        used to enforce the CSP distribution policy. New claims can be introduced in the future to extend the
        distribution policy capabilities.</t>
        <t>In order to provide distribution policy flexibility,
        the exact subset of claims used in a given signed JWT is a runtime decision.
        Claim requirements are defined in the <xref target="metadata" format="default">CDNI Metadata</xref>.
        If the CDNI Metadata interface is not used, or
        does not include claim requirements, the claim requirements
        can be set by configuration (out of scope of this document).</t>
        <t>The following claims (where the "JSON Web Token Claims" registry
        claim name is specified in parentheses below) are used to enforce the
        distribution policies.  All of the listed claims are mandatory
        to implement in a URI Signing implementation but are not necessarily
        mandatory to use in a given signed JWT. (The "optional" and
        "mandatory" identifiers in square brackets refer to whether or
        not a given claim <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present in a URI Signing JWT.)</t>
        <t>Note: The time on the entities that generate and
        verify the signed URI <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be in sync. In the CDNI case, this
        means that CSP, uCDN, and dCDN servers need to be
        time synchronized. It is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to use
        <xref target="RFC5905" format="default">NTP</xref> for time synchronization.</t>
        <t>Note: See the <xref target="security" format="default">Security
        Considerations</xref> on the limitations of using an
        expiration time and Client IP address for distribution policy
        enforcement.</t>

            If this claim is used, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used to identify the

            keys used to sign JWTs and must verify that the JWT was signed by one of
            those keys. If this claim is used and the CDN verifying the

        <name>Overview</name>
        <t>For content that is delivered via HTTP in a segmented fashion,
        such as <xref target="MPEG-DASH" format="default">MPEG-DASH</xref> or <xref target="RFC8216" format="default"> HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)</xref>,
        special provisions need to be made in order to ensure URI Signing can be
        applied. In general, segmented protocols work by breaking large objects
        (e.g., videos) into a sequence of small independent segments. Such segments
        are then referenced by a separate manifest file, which either includes
        a list of URLs to the segments or specifies an algorithm through which
        a User Agent can construct the URLs to the segments. Requests for segments
        therefore originate from the manifest file and, unless the URLs in the
        manifest file point to the CSP, are not subjected to redirection and URI Signing.
        This opens up a vulnerability to malicious User Agents sharing the
        manifest file and deep linking to the segments.</t>
        <t>One method for dealing with this vulnerability would be to include, in
        the manifest itself, Signed URIs that point to the individual segments.
        There exist a number of issues with that approach. First, it requires the
        CDN delivering the manifest to rewrite the manifest file for each User Agent,
        which would require the CDN to be aware of the exact segmentation protocol
        used. Secondly, it could also require the expiration time of the
        Signed URIs to be valid for an extended duration if the content
        described by the manifest is meant to be consumed in real time. For instance, if the manifest file were
        to contain a segmented video stream of more than 30 minutes in length,
        Signed URIs would require to be valid for at least 30 minutes, thereby reducing
        their effectiveness and that of the URI Signing mechanism in general.
        For a more detailed analysis of how segmented protocols such as HTTP Adaptive Streaming protocols affect CDNI,
        see <xref target="RFC6983" format="default">Models for HTTP-Adaptive-Streaming-Aware Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI)</xref>.</t>
        <t>The method described in this section allows CDNs to use URI Signing
        for segmented content without
        having to include the Signed URIs in the manifest files themselves.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="uri_signing_mechanism" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Signed Token Renewal Mechanism</name>
        <t>In order to allow for effective access control of segmented content, the
        URI Signing mechanism defined in this section is based on a method
        through which subsequent segment requests can be linked together.
        As part of the JWT verification procedure, the CDN can generate a new
        signed JWT that the UA can use to do a subsequent request. More specifically,
        whenever a UA successfully retrieves a segment, it receives, in the
        HTTP 2xx Successful message, a signed JWT that it can use whenever it
        requests the next segment. As long as each successive signed JWT
        is correctly verified before a new one is generated, the model is not
        broken, and the User Agent can successfully retrieve additional segments.
        Given the fact that with segmented protocols it is usually not possible to
        determine a priori which segment will be requested next (i.e., to allow for
        seeking within the content and for switching to a different representation),
        the Signed Token Renewal uses the
        URI Regular Expression Container scoping mechanisms in the URI Container
        (cdniuc) claim to allow a signed JWT to be valid for more than one URL.</t>
        <t>In order for this renewal of signed JWTs to work, it is necessary for
        a UA to extract the signed JWT from the HTTP 2xx Successful message of an
        earlier request and use it to retrieve the next segment. The exact mechanism
        by which the client does this is outside the scope of this document.
        However, in order to also support legacy UAs that do not include any
        specific provisions for the handling of signed JWTs, <xref target="communicating_token" format="default"/>
        defines a mechanism using HTTP Cookies <xref target="RFC6265" format="default"/> that allows such UAs to support
        the concept of renewing signed JWTs without requiring any additional UA support.</t>

        <t>When using the Signed Token Renewal mechanism, the signed JWT is
        transported to the UA via a 'URISigningPackage' cookie added to the
        HTTP 2xx Successful message along with the content being returned to

          might break if used in combination with an HTTP 3xx Redirection
          response where the target URL is in a different domain. In such
          scenarios, Signed Token Renewal of a signed JWT <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be communicated
          via the query string instead, in a similar fashion to how regular
          signed JWTs (outside of Signed Token Renewal) are communicated. Note

        <t>For DNS-based request routing, the CSP and uCDN must
        agree on a trust model appropriate to the security requirements of the
        CSP's particular content. Use of asymmetric public/private keys allows
        for unlimited distribution of the public key to dCDNs.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>This document describes the concept of URI Signing and how it can be
      used to provide access authorization in the case of
      CDNI. The primary goal of URI Signing is to make sure that only
      authorized UAs are able to access the content, with a
      CSP being able to authorize every individual request. It
      should be noted that URI Signing is not a content protection scheme; if
      a CSP wants to protect the content itself, other mechanisms, such as
      DRM, are more appropriate.</t>
      <t>CDNI URI Signing Signed Tokens leverage JSON Web Tokens and thus, guidelines in <xref target="RFC8725" format="default"/>
      are applicable for all JWT interactions.</t>
      <t>In general, it holds that the level of protection against
      illegitimate access can be increased by including more claims
      in the signed JWT. The current version of this document
      includes claims for enforcing Issuer, Client IP Address, Not Before time, and Expiration Time;
      however, this list can be extended with other more complex attributes
      that are able to provide some form of protection against some of the
      vulnerabilities highlighted below.</t>
      <t>That said, there are a number of aspects that limit the level of
      security offered by URI Signing and that anybody implementing URI
      Signing should be aware of.</t>


	<dl>
	  <dt>Replay attacks:
	  </dt>
	  <dd>A (valid) Signed URI may be used to perform replay attacks. The
	  vulnerability to replay attacks can be reduced by picking a
	  relatively short window between the Not Before time and Expiration
	  Time attributes, although this is limited by the fact that any
	  HTTP-based request needs a window of at least a couple of seconds to
	  prevent sudden network issues from denying legitimate UAs access to
	  the content. One may also reduce exposure to replay attacks by
	  including a unique one-time access ID via the JWT ID attribute (jti
	  claim). Whenever the dCDN receives a request with a given unique ID,
	  it adds that ID to the list of 'used' IDs. In the case an
	  illegitimate UA tries to use the same URI through a replay attack,
	  the dCDN can deny the request based on the already used access
	  ID. This list should be kept bounded. A reasonable approach would be
	  to expire the entries based on the exp claim value. If no exp claim
	  is present, then a simple LRU could be used; however, this would allow
	  values to eventually be reused.
<!-- [rfced] In the following sentence, what is the intended expansion for
"LRU"? Is "Least Recently Used (LRU) value" correct?

Original:
   If no exp claim is present then a simple LRU could be
   used, however this would allow values to eventually be reused.

Perhaps:
   If no exp claim is present, then a simple Least Recently Used (LRU)
   value could be used; however, this would allow values to eventually be reused.
-->
	  </dd>

	  <dt>Illegitimate clients behind a NAT:
	  </dt>
	  <dd>In cases where there are multiple users behind the same NAT, all
	  users will have the same IP address from the point of view of the
	  dCDN. This results in the dCDN not being able to distinguish between
	  different users based on Client IP Address, which can lead to
	  illegitimate users being able to access the content. One way to
	  reduce exposure to this kind of attack is to not only check for
	  Client IP but also for other attributes, e.g., attributes that can
	  be found in HTTP headers.  However, this may be easily circumvented
	  by a sophisticated attacker.
	  </dd>
	</dl>

	

     
      <t>A shared key distributed between CSP and uCDN is more likely to be
      compromised. Since this key can be used
      to legitimately sign a URL for content access authorization, it is
      important to know the implications of a compromised shared key. While
      using a shared key scheme can be convenient, this architecture is <bcp14>NOT
      RECOMMENDED</bcp14> due to the risks associated. It is included for legacy
      feature parity and is highly discouraged in new implementations.</t>
      <t>If a shared key usable for signing is compromised, an attacker
      can use it to perform a denial-of-service attack by forcing the CDN to
      evaluate prohibitively expensive regular expressions embedded in a
      URI Container (cdniuc) claim. As a result, compromised keys should be timely revoked
      in order to prevent exploitation.</t>
      <t>The URI Container (cdniuc) claim can be given a wildcard value. This, combined
      with the fact that it is the only mandatory claim, means you can effectively make
      a skeleton key. Doing this does not sufficiently limit the scope of the JWT and is
      <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>. The only way to prevent such a key from being used after it is
      distributed is to revoke the signing key so it no longer validates.</t>
