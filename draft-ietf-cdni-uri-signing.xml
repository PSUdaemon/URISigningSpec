    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how the concept of URI Signing supports the
      content access control requirements of Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) and proposes a URI Signing
      method as a JSON Web Token (JWT) profile.</t>

      <t>The proposed URI Signing method specifies the information needed to
      be included in the URI to transmit the signed JWT, as well as the claims needed
      by the signed JWT to authorize a User Agent (UA). The
      mechanism described can be used both in CDNI and single Content Delivery Network (CDN)
      scenarios.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes the concept of URI Signing and how it can be
      used to provide access authorization in the case of redirection between
      cooperating CDNs and between a Content Service Provider (CSP)
      and a CDN. The primary goal of URI Signing is to make sure that only
      authorized UAs are able to access the content, with a CSP
      being able to authorize every individual request. It should be noted
      that URI Signing is not a content protection scheme; if a CSP wants to
      protect the content itself, other mechanisms, such as Digital Rights Management (DRM), are more
      appropriate. In addition to access control, URI Signing also has
      benefits in reducing the impact of denial-of-service attacks.</t>

      <t>The overall problem space for CDN Interconnection (CDNI) is described
      in <xref target="RFC6707">CDNI Problem Statement</xref>. This
      document, along with the <xref target="RFC7337">CDNI Requirements</xref>
      document and the <xref target="RFC7336">CDNI Framework</xref>, describes the need
      for interconnected CDNs to be able to implement an access control
      mechanism that enforces a CSP's distribution policies.</t>

      <t>Specifically, the <xref target="RFC7336">CDNI Framework</xref>
      states:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
        <t>The CSP may also trust the CDN operator to perform actions such as
        delegating traffic to additional downstream CDNs, and to enforce per-request authorization performed by the CSP using
        techniques such as URI Signing.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>In particular, the following requirement is listed in the <xref
      target="RFC7337">CDNI Requirements</xref>:</t>

      <t><list style="empty">
        <t>MI-16 {HIGH} The CDNI Metadata interface shall allow signaling of
        authorization checks and verification that are to be performed by the
        Surrogate before delivery.  For example, this could potentially
        include the need to verify information (e.g., Expiry time, Client
        IP address) required for access authorization.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>This document defines a method of signing URIs that allows Surrogates in
      interconnected CDNs to enforce a per-request authorization initiated by
      the CSP. Splitting the role of initiating per-request authorization by
      the CSP and the role of verifying this authorization by the CDN allows
      any arbitrary distribution policy to be enforced across CDNs without the
      need of CDNs to have any awareness of the specific CSP distribution
      policies.</t>

      <t>The method is implemented using Signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) <xref target="RFC7519"/>.</t>

        <t>In addition, the following terms are used throughout this
        document:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Signed URI: A URI for which a signed JWT is provided.</t>

            <t>Target CDN URI: URI created by the CSP to direct a UA
            towards the Upstream CDN (uCDN). The Target CDN URI can be signed by the
            CSP and verified by the uCDN and possibly further Downstream CDNs (dCDNs).</t>

            <t>Redirection URI: URI created by the uCDN to redirect a UA
            towards the dCDN. The Redirection URI can be signed by
            the uCDN and verified by the dCDN. In a cascaded
            CDNI scenario, there can be more than one Redirection URI.</t>

            <t>Signed Token Renewal: A series of signed JWTs that are used for subsequent
            access to a set of related resources in a CDN, such as a set of HTTP
            Adaptive Streaming files. Every time a signed JWT is used to
            access a particular resource, a new signed JWT is sent along
            with the resource that can be used to request the next resource
            in the set. When generating a new signed JWT in Signed Token Renewal,
            parameters are carried over from one signed JWT to the next.</t>

      <section anchor="background"
               title="Background and overview on URI Signing ">
        <t>A CSP and CDN are assumed to have a trust relationship that enables
        the CSP to authorize access to a content item, which is
        realized in practice by including a set of claims in a signed JWT
        in the URI before redirecting a UA to the CDN. Using these
        attributes, it is possible for a CDN to check an incoming content
        request to see whether it was authorized by the CSP (e.g., based on the
        UA's IP address or a time window). To prevent the UA from altering the claims
        a JWT MUST be signed.</t>

        <t>Figure 1, shown below, presents an overview of the URI Signing
        mechanism in the case of a CSP with a single CDN. When the UA browses
        for content on CSP's website (#1), it receives HTML web pages with
        embedded content URIs. Upon requesting these URIs, the CSP redirects
        to a CDN, creating a Target CDN URI (#2) (alternatively, the Target
        CDN URI itself is embedded in the HTML). The Target CDN URI is the
        Signed URI which may include the IP address of the UA and/or a time
        window. The signed URI always contains a signed JWT generated by the
        CSP using a shared secret or private key. Once the UA receives the
        response with the Signed URI, it sends a new HTTP request using the
        Signed URI to the CDN (#3). Upon receiving the request, the CDN
        authenticates the Signed URI by verifying the signed JWT.
        If applicable, the CDN checks whether the source IP address of the HTTP
        request matches the one in the Signed URI and/or if the time window is still
        valid. After these claims are verified, the CDN delivers
        the content (#4).</t>

      <section title="CDNI URI Signing Overview">
        <t>In a CDNI environment, as shown in Figure 2 below, URI Signing operates the same way in the
        initial steps #1 and #2 but the later steps involve multiple CDNs
        delivering the content. The main difference from the
        single CDN case is a redirection step between the uCDN and the
        dCDN. In step #3, the UA may send an HTTP request or a DNS request,
        depending on whether HTTP-based or DNS-based request routing is used.
        The uCDN responds by directing the UA towards the
        dCDN using either a Redirection URI (i.e., a Signed URI generated by
        the uCDN) or a DNS reply, respectively (#4). Once the UA
        receives the response, it sends the Redirection URI/Target CDN URI to
        the dCDN (#5). The received URI is verified by the
        dCDN before delivering the content (#6). Note: The CDNI call flows are covered in <xref
        target="operation">Detailed URI Signing Operation</xref>.</t>

        <t>The trust relationships between CSP, uCDN, and
        dCDN have direct implications for URI Signing. In the case shown in
        Figure 2, the CSP has a trust relationship with the
        uCDN. The delivery of the content may be delegated to a
        dCDN, which has a relationship with the uCDN but may
        have no relationship with the CSP.</t>

        <t>In CDNI, there are two methods for request routing: DNS-based and
        HTTP-based. For DNS-based request routing, the Signed URI (i.e., the Target
        CDN URI) provided by the CSP reaches the dCDN directly. In
        the case where the dCDN does not have a trust relationship
        with the CSP, this means that either an asymmetric public/private key
        method needs to be used for computing the signed JWT (because the CSP and
        dCDN are not able to exchange symmetric shared secret keys), or
        the CSP needs
        to allow the uCDN to redistribute shared keys
        to a subset of their dCDNs.</t>

        <t>For HTTP-based request routing, the Signed URI (i.e., the Target CDN
        URI) provided by the CSP reaches the uCDN. After this URI has
        been verified by the uCDN, the uCDN
        creates and signs a new Redirection URI, redirecting the UA to the
        dCDN. Since this new URI can have a new signed JWT, the relationship between the
        dCDN and CSP is not relevant. Because a
        relationship between uCDN and dCDN always exists,
        either asymmetric public/private keys or symmetric shared secret keys
        can be used for URI Signing with HTTP-based request routing. Note that the signed Redirection URI MUST
        maintain HTTPS as the scheme if it was present in the original and it MAY be upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS.</t>

        <t>Two types of keys can be used for URI Signing: asymmetric keys and
        symmetric keys. Asymmetric keys are based on a public/private key pair
        mechanism and always contain a private key known only to the entity
        signing the URI (either CSP or uCDN) and a public key for the
        verification of the Signed URI. With symmetric keys, the same key is
        used by both the signing entity for signing the URI and the
        verifying entity for verifying the Signed URI. Regardless of the type
        of keys used, the verifying entity has to obtain the key in a manner that allows trust to
        be placed in the assertions made using that key (either the
        public or the symmetric key). There are very different requirements
        (outside the scope of this document) for distributing asymmetric keys
        and symmetric keys. Key distribution for symmetric keys requires
        confidentiality to prevent third parties from getting access to the key,
        since they could then generate valid Signed URIs for unauthorized
        requests. Key distribution for asymmetric keys does not require
        confidentiality since public keys can typically be distributed openly
        (because they cannot be used to sign URIs) and the corresponding private keys are kept
        secret by the URI signer.</t>

      <section title="URI Signing in a non-CDNI context">
        <t>While the URI Signing method defined in this document was primarily
        created for the purpose of allowing URI Signing in CDNI scenarios,
        i.e., between a uCDN and a dCDN, there is
        nothing in the defined URI Signing method that precludes it from being
        used in a non-CDNI context. As such, the described mechanism could be
        used in a single-CDN scenario such as shown in <xref target="fig_single_cdn"/>
        in <xref target="background"/>, for example
        to allow a CSP that uses different CDNs to only have to implement a
        single URI Signing mechanism.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="jwt_profile" title="JWT Format and Processing Requirements">
      <t>The concept behind URI Signing is based on embedding a signed <xref target="RFC7519">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>
      in an <xref target="RFC7230">HTTP or HTTPS URI</xref> (see [RFC7230] Section 2.7). The signed JWT contains a number of
      claims that can be verified to ensure the UA has legitimate access to the content.</t>

      <t>This document specifies the following attribute for embedding a signed JWT in a Target CDN URI or Redirection URI:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>URI Signing Package (URISigningPackage): The URI attribute that
          encapsulates all the URI Signing claims in a signed JWT encoded
          format. This attribute is exposed in the Signed URI as a path-style parameter
          or a form-style parameter.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The parameter name of the URI Signing Package Attribute is
      defined in the <xref target="metadata">CDNI Metadata</xref>. If the CDNI Metadata interface
      is not used, or does not include a parameter name for the URI Signing
      Package Attribute, the parameter name can be set by configuration (out of
      scope of this document).</t>

      <t>The URI Signing Package will be found by parsing any path-style parameters and
     form-style parameters looking for a key name matching the URI Signing Package Attribute.
     Both parameter styles MUST be supported to allow flexibility of operation.
     The first matching parameter SHOULD be taken to provide the signed JWT, though providing
     more than one matching key is undefined behavior.</t>

     <t>The following is an example where the URI Signing Package Attribute name is "token" and the signed JWT is "SIGNEDJWT":</t>
       <figure><artwork>http://example.com/media/path?come=data&amp;token=SIGNEDJWT&amp;other=data</artwork></figure>

      <section anchor="jwt_claims" title="JWT Claims">
        <t>This section identifies the set of claims that can be
        used to enforce the CSP distribution policy. New claims can be introduced in the future to extend the
        distribution policy capabilities.</t>

        <t>In order to provide distribution policy flexibility,
        the exact subset of claims used in a given signed JWT is a runtime decision.
        Claim requirements are defined in the <xref target="metadata">CDNI Metadata</xref>.
        If the CDNI Metadata interface is not used, or
        does not include claim requirements, the claim requirements
        can be set by configuration (out of scope of this document).</t>

        <t>The following claims (where the "JSON Web Token Claims" registry
        claim name is specified in parenthesis below) are used to enforce the
        distribution policies.  All of the listed claims are mandatory
        to implement in a URI Signing implementation, but are not
        mandatory to use in a given signed JWT. (The "optional" and
        "mandatory" identifiers in square brackets refer to whether or
        not a given claim MUST be present in a URI Signing JWT.)</t>

        <t>Note: The time on the entities that generate and
        verify the signed URI MUST be in sync. In the CDNI case, this
        means that CSP, uCDN, and dCDN servers need to be
        time-synchronized. It is RECOMMENDED to use
        <xref target="RFC5905">NTP</xref> for time synchronization.</t>

        <t>Note: See the <xref target="security">Security
        Considerations</xref> section on the limitations of using an

        <t>For content that is delivered via HTTP in a segmented fashion,
        such as <xref target="MPEG-DASH">MPEG-DASH</xref> or <xref target="RFC8216"> HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)</xref>,
        special provisions need to be made in order to ensure URI Signing can be
        applied. In general, segmented protocols work by breaking large objects
        (e.g., videos) into a sequence of small independent segments. Such segments
        are then referenced by a separate manifest file, which either includes
        a list of URLs to the segments or specifies an algorithm through which
        a User Agent can construct the URLs to the segments. Requests for segments
        therefore originate from the manifest file and, unless the URLs in the
        manifest file point to the CSP, are not subjected to redirection and URI Signing.
        This opens up a vulnerability to malicious User Agents sharing the
        manifest file and deep-linking to the segments.</t>

        <t>One method for dealing with this vulnerability would be to include, in
        the manifest itself, Signed URIs that point to the individual segments.
        There exist a number of issues with that approach. First, it requires the
        CDN delivering the manifest to rewrite the manifest file for each User Agent,
        which would require the CDN to be aware of the exact segmentation protocol
        used. Secondly, it could also require the expiration time of the
        Signed URIs to be valid for an extended duration if the content
        described by the manifest is meant to be consumed in real time. For instance, if the manifest file were
        to contain a segmented video stream of more than 30 minutes in length,
        Signed URIs would require to be valid for a at least 30 minutes, thereby reducing
        their effectiveness and that of the URI Signing mechanism in general.
        For a more detailed analysis of how segmented protocols such as HTTP Adaptive Streaming protocols affect CDNI,
        see <xref target="RFC6983">Models for HTTP-Adaptive-Streaming-Aware CDNI</xref>.</t>

        <t>The method described in this section allows CDNs to use URI Signing
        for segmented content without
        having to include the Signed URIs in the manifest files themselves.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="uri_signing_mechanism" title="Signed Token Renewal mechanism">
        <t>In order to allow for effective access control of segmented content, the
        URI Signing mechanism defined in this section is based on a method
        through which subsequent segment requests can be linked together.
        As part of the JWT verification procedure, the CDN can generate a new
        signed JWT that the UA can use to do a subsequent request. More specifically,
        whenever a UA successfully retrieves a segment, it receives, in the
        HTTP 2xx Successful message, a signed JWT that it can use whenever it
        requests the next segment. As long as each successive signed JWT
        is correctly verified before a new one is generated, the model is not
        broken and the User Agent can successfully retrieve additional segments.
        Given the fact that with segmented protocols, it is usually not possible to
        determine a priori which segment will be requested next (i.e., to allow for
        seeking within the content and for switching to a different representation),
        the Signed Token Renewal uses the
        URI Regular Expression Container scoping mechanisms in the URI Container
        (cdniuc) claim to allow a signed JWT to be valid for more than one URL.</t>

        <t>In order for this renewal of signed JWTs to work, it is necessary for
        a UA to extract the signed JWT from the HTTP 2xx Successful message of an
        earlier request and use it to retrieve the next segment. The exact mechanism
        by which the client does this is outside the scope of this document.
        However, in order to also support legacy UAs that do not include any
        specific provisions for the handling of signed JWTs, <xref target="communicating_token"/>
        defines a mechanism using HTTP Cookies <xref target="RFC6265"/> that allows such UAs to support
        the concept of renewing signed JWTs without requiring any additional UA support.</t>

        has been set to 1.</t>

        <t>When using the Signed Token Renewal mechanism, the signed JWT is
        transported to the UA via a 'URISigningPackage' cookie added to the
        HTTP 2xx Successful message along with the content being returned to
        the UA, or to the HTTP 3xx Redirection message in case the UA is
        redirected to a different server.</t>

        <section title="Support for cross-domain redirection">
          <t>For security purposes, the use of cross-domain cookies is not supported
          in some application environments. As a result, the Cookie-based
          method for transport of the Signed Token described in <xref target="communicating_token"/>
          might break if used in combination with an HTTP 3xx Redirection
          response where the target URL is in a different domain. In such
          scenarios, Signed Token Renewal of a signed JWT SHOULD be communicated
          via the query string instead, in a similar fashion to how regular
          signed JWTs (outside of Signed Token Renewal) are communicated. Note
          the value of the CDNI Signed Token Transport (cdnistt) claim
          MUST be set to 2.</t>

          <t>Note that the process described herein only works in cases where both the manifest
          file and segments constituting the segmented content are delivered from
          the same domain. In other words, any redirection between different domains needs to be
          carried out while retrieving the manifest file.</t>

      <t>Some of the CDNI Interfaces need enhancements to support URI Signing.
      A dCDN that supports URI Signing needs to be
      able to advertise this capability to the uCDN. The uCDN
      needs to select a dCDN based on such capability when the CSP
      requires access control to enforce its distribution policy via URI
      Signing. Also, the uCDN needs to be able to distribute via the
      CDNI Metadata interface the information necessary to allow the
      dCDN to verify a Signed URI. Events that pertain to URI
      Signing (e.g., request denial or delivery after an access authorization decision has been made)
      need to be included in the logs communicated through the CDNI Logging

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Using the CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement
            interface, the dCDN advertises its capabilities
            including URI Signing support to the uCDN.</t>

            <t>CSP provides to the uCDN the information needed to
            verify Signed JWTs from that CSP. For example, this
            information will include one or more keys used for validation.</t>

            <t>Using the CDNI Metadata interface, the uCDN
            communicates to a dCDN the information needed to
            verify Signed JWTs from the CSP (e.g., the URI query
            string parameter name for the URI Signing Package Attribute). In
            the case of symmetric key, the uCDN checks if the
            dCDN is allowed by CSP to obtain the shared secret
            key.</t>

            <t>When a UA requests a piece of protected content from the CSP,
            the CSP makes a specific authorization decision for this unique
            request based on its local distribution policy.</t>

            <t>If the authorization decision is negative, the CSP rejects the
            request and sends an error code (e.g., 403 Forbidden) in the HTTP
            response.</t>

            <t>If the authorization decision is positive, the CSP computes a
            Signed JWT that is based on unique parameters of that
            request and includes it in the URI provided to the end user to
            request the content.</t>

            <t>End user sends DNS request to the uCDN.</t>

            <t>On receipt of the DNS request, the uCDN redirects
            the request to the dCDN.</t>

            <t>End user sends DNS request to the dCDN.</t>

            <t>On receipt of the DNS request, the dCDN responds with
            IP address of one of its Surrogates.</t>

            <t>On receipt of the corresponding content request, the
            dCDN verifies the Signed JWT in the URI using the
            information provided by the uCDN in the CDNI
            Metadata.</t>

            <t>If the verification result is negative, the dCDN rejects the
            request and sends an error code 403 Forbidden in the HTTP
            response.</t>

            <t>If the verification result is positive, the dCDN serves the
            request and delivers the content.</t>

            <t>At a later time, dCDN reports logging events that
            includes URI Signing information.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>With DNS-based request routing, URI Signing matches well the
        general chain of trust model of CDNI when used with asymmetric keys
        because the only key information that needs to be distributed across
        multiple, possibly untrusted, CDNI hops is the public key, which
        is generally not confidential.</t>

        <t>With DNS-based request routing, URI Signing does not match well with the
        general chain of trust model of CDNI when used with symmetric keys
        because the symmetric key information needs to be distributed across
        multiple CDNI hops, to CDNs with which the CSP may not have a trust
        relationship. This raises a security concern for applicability of URI
        Signing with symmetric keys in case of DNS-based inter-CDN request
        routing. Due to these concerns, this architecture is NOT RECOMMENDED.</t>

        <t>Generally speaking, we should determine the registration has a rational justification
         and does not duplicate a previous registration. Early assignment should be permissible as long
         as there is a reasonable expectation that the specification will become formalized. Expert
         Reviewers should be empowered to make determinations, but generally speaking they should allow
         new claims that do not otherwise introduce conflicts with implementation or things that may lead
         to confusion.  They should also follow the guidelines of <xref target="RFC8126"/> Section 5 when sensible.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes the concept of URI Signing and how it can be
      used to provide access authorization in the case of
      CDNI. The primary goal of URI Signing is to make sure that only
      authorized UAs are able to access the content, with a
      CSP being able to authorize every individual request. It
      should be noted that URI Signing is not a content protection scheme; if
      a CSP wants to protect the content itself, other mechanisms, such as
      DRM, are more appropriate.</t>

      <t>CDNI URI Signing Signed Tokens leverage JSON Web Tokens and thus guidelines in <xref target="RFC8725"/>
      are applicable for all JWT interactions.</t>

      <t>In general, it holds that the level of protection against
      illegitimate access can be increased by including more claims
      in the signed JWT. The current version of this document
      includes claims for enforcing Issuer, Client IP Address, Not Before time, and Expiration Time,
      however this list can be extended with other, more complex, attributes
      that are able to provide some form of protection against some of the
      vulnerabilities highlighted below.</t>

      <t>That said, there are a number of aspects that limit the level of
      security offered by URI Signing and that anybody implementing URI
      Signing should be aware of.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Replay attacks: A (valid) Signed URI may be used to perform
          replay attacks. The vulnerability to replay attacks can be reduced
          by picking a relatively short window between the Not Before time and Expiration Time
          attributes, although this is limited by the fact that any HTTP-based
          request needs a window of at least a couple of seconds to prevent
          sudden network issues from denying legitimate UAs access to
          the content. One may also reduce exposure to replay attacks by
          including a unique one-time access ID via the JWT ID attribute (jti claim). Whenever the
          dCDN receives a request with a given unique ID, it
          adds that ID to the list of 'used' IDs. In the case an
          illegitimate UA tries to use the same URI through a replay attack,
          the dCDN can deny the request based on the already-used
          access ID. This list should be kept bounded. A reasonable approach
          would be to expire the entries based on the exp claim value. If no exp claim is present
          then a simple LRU could be used, however this would allow values to eventually be reused.</t>

          <t>Illegitimate clients behind a NAT: In cases where there are
          multiple users behind the same NAT, all users will have the same IP
          address from the point of view of the dCDN. This results
          in the dCDN not being able to distinguish between
          different users based on Client IP Address which can lead to illegitimate users
          being able to access the content. One way to reduce exposure to this
          kind of attack is to not only check for Client IP but also for other
          attributes, e.g., attributes that can be found in HTTP headers.
          However, this may be easily circumvented by a sophisticated attacker.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The shared key between CSP and uCDN may be distributed
      to dCDNs - including cascaded CDNs. Since this key can be used
      to legitimately sign a URL for content access authorization, it is
      important to know the implications of a compromised shared key. While
      using a shared key scheme can be convenient, this architecture is NOT
      RECOMMENDED due to the risks associated. It is included for legacy
      feature parity and is highly discouraged in new implementations.</t>

      <t>If a shared key usable for signing is compromised, an attacker
      can use it to perform a denial-of-service attack by forcing the CDN to
      evaluate prohibitively expensive regular expressions embedded in a
      cdniuc claim. As a result, compromised keys should be timely revoked
      in order to prevent exploitation.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy">
      <t>The privacy protection concerns described in <xref
      target="RFC7937">CDNI Logging Interface</xref> apply when
      the client's IP address (cdniip) or Subject (sub) is embedded in the Signed URI.
      For this reason, the mechanism described in <xref
      target="jwt_profile"/> encrypts the Client IP or Subject before
      including it in the URI Signing Package (and thus the URL itself).</t>
