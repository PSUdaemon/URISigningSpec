    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how the concept of URI signing supports the
      content access control requirements of CDNI and proposes a URI signing
      method as a <xref target="RFC7519">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref> profile.</t>

      <t>The proposed URI signing method specifies the information needed to
      be included in the URI to transmit the signed JWT as well as the claims needed
      by the signed JWT to authorize a UA. The
      mechanism described can be used both in CDNI and single CDN
      scenarios.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes the concept of URI Signing and how it can be
      used to provide access authorization in the case of redirection between
      interconnected CDNs (CDNI) and between a Content Service Provider (CSP)
      and a CDN. The primary goal of URI Signing is to make sure that only
      authorized User Agents (UAs) are able to access the content, with a CSP
      being able to authorize every individual request. It should be noted
      that URI Signing is not a content protection scheme; if a CSP wants to
      protect the content itself, other mechanisms, such as DRM, are more
      appropriate. In addition to access control, URI Signing also has
      benefits in reducing the impact of denial-of-service attacks.</t>

      <t>The overall problem space for CDN Interconnection (CDNI) is described
      in <xref target="RFC6707">CDNI Problem Statement</xref>. This
      document, along with the <xref target="RFC7337">CDNI Requirements</xref>
      document and the <xref target="RFC7336">CDNI Framework</xref>, describes the need
      for interconnected CDNs to be able to implement an access control
      mechanism that enforces the CSP's distribution policy.</t>

      <t>Specifically, <xref target="RFC7336">CDNI Framework</xref>
      states:</t>

      <t>"The CSP may also trust the CDN operator to perform actions such as
      ..., and to enforce per-request authorization performed by the CSP using
      techniques such as URI signing."</t>

      <t>In particular, the following requirement is listed in <xref
      target="RFC7337">CDNI Requirements</xref>:</t>

      <t>"MI-16 [HIGH] The CDNI Metadata Distribution interface shall allow
      signaling of authorization checks and validation that are to be
      performed by the surrogate before delivery. For example, this could
      potentially include:</t>

      <t>* need to validate URI signed information (e.g., Expiry time, Client
      IP address)."</t>

      <t>This document proposes a method of signing URIs that allows Surrogates in
      interconnected CDNs to enforce a per-request authorization performed by
      the CSP. Splitting the role of performing per-request authorization by
      the CSP and the role of validating this authorization by the CDN allows
      any arbitrary distribution policy to be enforced across CDNs without the
      need of CDNs to have any awareness of the actual CSP distribution
      policy.</t>
      
      <t>The representation of this method is a Signed JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/>.</t>

            <t>Target CDN URI: URI created by the CSP to direct UA
            towards the Upstream CDN (uCDN). The Target CDN URI can be signed by the
            CSP and verified by the uCDN.</t>

            <t>Redirection URI: URI created by the uCDN to redirect UA
            towards the Downstream CDN (dCDN). The Redirection URI can be signed by
            the uCDN and verified by the dCDN. In a cascaded
            CDNI scenario, there can be more than one Redirection URI.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="background"
               title="Background and overview on URI Signing ">
        <t>A CSP and CDN are assumed to have a trust relationship that enables
        the CSP to authorize access to a content item by including a set of
        claims in the form of a signed JWT in the URI before redirecting a UA to the CDN. Using these
        attributes, it is possible for a CDN to check an incoming content
        request to see whether it was authorized by the CSP (e.g., based on the
        UA's IP address or a time window). To prevent the UA from altering the claims
        a signed JWT is REQUIRED.</t>

        <t>Figure 1, shown below, presents an overview of the URI Signing
        mechanism in the case of a CSP with a single CDN. When the UA browses
        for content on CSP's website (#1), it receives HTML web pages with
        embedded content URIs. Upon requesting these URIs, the CSP redirects
        to a CDN, creating a Target CDN URI (#2) (alternatively, the Target
        CDN URI itself is embedded in the HTML). The Target CDN URI is the
        Signed URI which may include the IP address of the UA and/or a time
        window and always contains the signed JWT which is generated by the
        CSP using a shared secret or private key. Once the UA receives the
        response with the Signed URI, it sends a new HTTP request using the
        Signed URI to the CDN (#3). Upon receiving the request, the CDN
        checks to see if the Signed URI is authentic by verifying the signed JWT.
        If applicable, it checks whether the IP address of the HTTP
        request matches that in the Signed URI and if the time window is still
        valid. After these claims are confirmed to be valid, the CDN delivers
        the content (#4).</t>

      <section title="CDNI URI Signing Overview">
        <t>In a CDNI environment, URI Signing operates the same way in the
        initial steps #1 and #2 but the later steps involve multiple CDNs in
        the process of delivering the content. The main difference from the
        single CDN case is a redirection step between the uCDN and the
        dCDN. In step #3, UA may send an HTTP request or a DNS request.
        Depending on whether HTTP-based or DNS-based request routing is used,
        the uCDN responds by directing the UA towards the
        dCDN using either a Redirection URI (which is a Signed URI generated by
        the uCDN) or a DNS reply, respectively (#4). Once the UA
        receives the response, it sends the Redirection URI/Target CDN URI to
        the dCDN (#5). The received URI is validated by the
        dCDN before delivering the content (#6). This is depicted in
        the figure below. Note: The CDNI call flows are covered in <xref
        target="operation">Detailed URI Signing Operation</xref>.</t>

        <t>The trust relationships between CSP, uCDN, and
        dCDN have direct implications for URI Signing. In the case shown in
        Figure 2, the CDN that the CSP has a trust relationship with is the
        uCDN. The delivery of the content may be delegated to the
        dCDN, which has a relationship with the uCDN but may
        have no relationship with the CSP.</t>

        <t>In CDNI, there are two methods for request routing: DNS-based and
        HTTP-based. For DNS-based request routing, the Signed URI (i.e., Target
        CDN URI) provided by the CSP reaches the dCDN directly. In
        the case where the dCDN does not have a trust relationship
        with the CSP, this means that either an asymmetric public/private key
        method needs to be used for computing the signed JWT (because the CSP and
        dCDN are not able to exchange symmetric shared secret keys), or
        the CSP needs
        to allow the uCDN to redistribute shared keys
        to a subset of their dCDNs .</t>

        <t>For HTTP-based request routing, the Signed URI (i.e., Target CDN
        URI) provided by the CSP reaches the uCDN. After this URI has
        been verified to be correct by the uCDN, the uCDN
        creates and signs a new Redirection URI to redirect the UA to the
        dCDN. Since this new URI also has a new signed JWT, this
        new signature can be based around the trust relationship between the
        uCDN and dCDN, and the relationship between the
        dCDN and CSP is not relevant. Given the fact that such a
        relationship between uCDN and dCDN always exists,
        both asymmetric public/private keys and symmetric shared secret keys
        can be used for URI Signing with HTTP-based request routing. Note that the signed Redirection URI MUST
        maintain the same, or higher, level of security as the original Signed
        URI.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="URI Signing in a non-CDNI context">
        <t>While the URI signing method defined in this document was primarily
        created for the purpose of allowing URI Signing in CDNI scenarios,
        e.g., between a uCDN and a dCDN or between a CSP and a dCDN, there is
        nothing in the defined URI Signing method that precludes it from being
        used in a non-CDNI context. As such, the described mechanism could be
        used in a single-CDN scenario such as shown in <xref
        target="fig_single_cdn"/> in <xref target="background"/>, for example
        to allow a CSP that uses different CDNs to only have to implement a
        single URI Signing mechanism.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="jwt_profile" title="JWT Format and Processing Requirements">
      <t>The concept behind URI Signing is based on embedding a signed <xref target="RFC7519">JSON Web Token (JWT)
    </xref> in the Target
      CDN URI/Redirection URI.  The signed JWT contains a number of claims that can be validated to ensure the
      UA has legitimate access to the content.</t>

      <t>In addition, this document specifies the following URI
      attribute:</t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>URI Signing Package (URISigningPackage): The URI attribute that
          encapsulates all the URI Signing claims in a signed JWT encoded
          format. This attribute is exposed in the Signed URI as a URI
          query parameter or as a URL path parameter.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The parameter name of the URI Signing Package Attribute is
      defined in the CDNI Metadata. If the CDNI Metadata interface
      is not used, or does not include a parameter name for the URI Signing
      Package Attribute, the parameter name can be set by configuration (out of
      scope of this document).</t>

      <section anchor="jwt_claims" title="JWT Claims">
        <t>This section identifies the set of claims that can be
        used to enforce the CSP distribution policy. New claims can be introduced in the future to extend the
        distribution policy capabilities.</t>

        <t>In order to provide distribution policy flexibility,
        the exact subset of claims used in a given signed JWT is a runtime decision. 
        Claim requirements are defined in the
        CDNI Metadata. If the CDNI Metadata interface is not used, or
        does not include claim requirements, the claim requirements
        can be set by configuration (out of scope of this document).</t>

        <t>The following claims (where the "JSON Web Token Claims" registry
        claim name is specified in parenthesis below) are used to enforce the
        distribution policies.  All of the listed claims are mandatory
        to implement in a URI Signing implementation, but are not
        mandatory to use in a given signed JWT. (The "optional" and
        "mandatory" identifiers in square brackets refer to whether or
        not a given claim MUST be present in a URI Signing JWT.)
        A CDN MUST be able to parse and process all of the claims
        listed below.  If the signed JWT contains any claims which the
        CDN does not understand (i.e., is unable to parse and
        process), the CDN SHOULD ignore them.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Issuer (iss) [optional] - The semantics in
            <xref target="RFC7519"/> Section 4.1.1 MUST be followed. This
            claim MAY be used to validate authorization of the issuer of a
            signed JWT and also MAY be used to confirm that the indicated key
            was provided by said issuer.  If the CDN validating the
            signed JWT does not support Issuer validation, or if the
            Issuer in the signed JWT does not match the list of known
            acceptable Issuers, the CDN MUST reject the request. If the
            received signed JWT contains an Issuer claim, then any
            JWT subsequently generated for CDNI redirection MUST also contain an Issuer
            claim, and the Issuer value MUST be updated to identify the
            redirecting CDN.  If the received signed JWT does not
            contain an Issuer claim, an Issuer claim MAY be added to
            a signed JWT generated for CDNI redirection.</t> 

            <t>URI Container (sub) [mandatory] - The semantics in <xref target="RFC7519"/> Section 4.1.2 MUST be followed.

      As an example: A dCDN that supports URI Signing needs to be

      needs to select a dCDN based on such capability when the CSP
      requires access control to enforce its distribution policy via URI
      Signing. Also, the uCDN needs to be able to distribute via the
      CDNI Metadata interface the information necessary to allow the
      dCDN to validate a Signed URI. Events that pertain to URI
      Signing (e.g., request denial or delivery after access authorization)

      Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web

            <t>Using the CDNI Metadata interface, the uCDN
            communicates to a dCDN the information needed to

            CSP. For example, this information may include the URI query
            string parameter name for the URI Signing Package Attribute.</t>

            <t>When a UA requests a piece of protected content from the CSP,

            <t>If the authorization decision is negative, the CSP rejects the

            <t>If the authorization decision is positive, the CSP computes a

            <t>If the validation is negative, the dCDN rejects the

        <t>With HTTP-based request routing, URI Signing matches well the
        general chain of trust model of CDNI both with symmetric and
        asymmetric keys because the key information only needs to be specific
        to a pair of adjacent CDNI hops.</t>

      <section anchor="dns" title="DNS Redirection">
        <t>For DNS-based request routing, the CSP and uCDN must
        agree on a trust model appropriate to the security requirements of the
        CSP's particular content. Use of asymmetric public/private keys allows
        for unlimited distribution of the public key to dCDNs.
        However, if a shared secret key is preferred, then the CSP may want to
        restrict the distribution of the key to a (possibly empty) subset of
        trusted dCDNs. Authorized Delivery CDNs need to obtain the
        key information to validate the Signed URI.</t>

        <t>The URI signing method described below is based on the following
        steps (assuming iterative DNS request routing and a CDN path with two
        CDNs).</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes the concept of URI Signing and how it can be
      used to provide access authorization in the case of
      CDNI. The primary goal of URI Signing is to make sure that only
      authorized UAs are able to access the content, with a
      CSP being able to authorize every individual request. It
      should be noted that URI Signing is not a content protection scheme; if
      a CSP wants to protect the content itself, other mechanisms, such as
      DRM, are more appropriate.</t>

      <t>In general, it holds that the level of protection against
      illegitimate access can be increased by including more claims
      in the signed JWT. The current version of this document
      includes claims for enforcing Issuer, Client IP Address, Not Before time, and Expiration Time,
      however this list can be extended with other, more complex, attributes
      that are able to provide some form of protection against some of the
      vulnerabilities highlighted below.</t>

      <t>That said, there are a number of aspects that limit the level of
      security offered by URI Signing and that anybody implementing URI
      Signing should be aware of.</t>

      <t><list>
          <t>Replay attacks: A (valid) Signed URI may be used to perform
          replay attacks. The vulnerability to replay attacks can be reduced
          by picking a relatively short window between the Not Before time and Expiration Time
          attributes, although this is limited by the fact that any HTTP-based
          request needs a window of at least a couple of seconds to prevent
          a sudden network issues from preventing legitimate UAs access to
          the content. One may also reduce exposure to replay attacks by
          including a unique one-time access ID via the Nonce attribute (jti claim). Whenever the
          dCDN receives a request with a given unique ID, it
          adds that ID to the list of 'used' IDs. In the case an
          illegitimate UA tries to use the same URI through a replay attack,
          the dCDN can deny the request based on the already-used
          access ID.</t>

          <t>Illegitimate clients behind a NAT: In cases where there are
          multiple users behind the same NAT, all users will have the same IP
          address from the point of view of the dCDN. This results
          in the dCDN not being able to distinguish between the
          different users based on Client IP Address and illegitimate users
          being able to access the content. One way to reduce exposure to this
          kind of attack is to not only check for Client IP but also for other
          attributes, e.g., attributes that can be found in HTTP headers.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The shared key between CSP and uCDN may be distributed
      to dCDNs - including cascaded CDNs. Since this key can be used
      to legitimately sign a URL for content access authorization, it is
      important to know the implications of a compromised shared key.</t>

      <t>In the case where asymmetric keys are used, the KID information
      element might contain the URL to the public key. To prevent malicious
      clients from signing their own URIs and inserting the associated public
      key URL in the KID field, thereby passing URI validation, it is
      important that CDNs check whether the URI conveyed in the KID field is
      in the allowable set of KIDs as listed in the CDNI metadata or set via
      configuration.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy">
      <t>The privacy protection concerns described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-cdni-logging">CDNI Logging Interface</xref> apply when
      the client's IP address (aud) is embedded in the Signed URI.
      For this reason, the mechanism described in <xref
      target="jwt_profile"/> encrypts the Client IP before
      including it in the URI Signing Package (and thus the URL itself).</t>
